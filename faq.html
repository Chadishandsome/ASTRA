    <section class="faq-list">

      <details class="faq-item" open>
        <summary>What is ASTRA?</summary>
        <p>ASTRA is a software concept that tracks satellites and debris, predicts close approaches, and helps assess collision risk in Earth orbit.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>What problem is ASTRA trying to solve?</summary>
        <p>ASTRA focuses on the growing risk of collisions in crowded orbits, where even one impact can create thousands of debris fragments that threaten other missions.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>How does ASTRA track satellites and debris?</summary>
        <p>ASTRA ingests orbital data, such as catalogs and orbital elements, and uses it to maintain an up to date picture of where satellites and debris are in space.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>What is a conjunction?</summary>
        <p>A conjunction is a predicted close approach between two objects in orbit, such as a satellite and a piece of debris, where the distance between them becomes small enough to be a concern.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>How does ASTRA predict close approaches?</summary>
        <p>Using orbital models, ASTRA propagates the orbits of objects forward in time and checks for times when their paths pass close to one another.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>How does ASTRA estimate collision risk?</summary>
        <p>ASTRA looks at factors like miss distance, relative speed, and uncertainty in the orbit data to give each event a simple collision risk score.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Does ASTRA actually move satellites?</summary>
        <p>No. ASTRA does not control satellites directly. It is meant to help human operators decide when a maneuver might be needed and what options are safer.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Where does ASTRA get its data from?</summary>
        <p>In this school project, ASTRA uses example orbital data and assumed inputs. A real system could use public satellite catalogs and tracking data from sensors.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Can ASTRA work with real space agencies in the future?</summary>
        <p>The current version is a concept and demonstration, but the ideas behind ASTRA are similar to tools that real operators could use to manage collision risk.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Why is space debris such a big issue?</summary>
        <p>Every piece of debris travels at very high speed. Even a small fragment can damage or destroy a satellite, and collisions can generate more debris that stays in orbit for years.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>What happens if two objects collide in orbit?</summary>
        <p>A collision can create a cloud of fragments that spread out along the orbit and increase the risk for many other satellites over time.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>How is the ASTRA visualization used?</summary>
        <p>The visualization lets users see orbits, track close approaches over time, and inspect which encounters are more dangerous in a clear, visual way.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Does ASTRA run in real time?</summary>
        <p>In this project, ASTRA runs on preloaded data and simulated time steps. A real implementation could update more frequently as new tracking data arrives.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Who is ASTRA designed for?</summary>
        <p>ASTRA is aimed at mission planners, satellite operators, and students who want a clearer view of how conjunctions and collision risks develop in orbit.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Is ASTRA a finished product or a school project?</summary>
        <p>This version of ASTRA is a student project built to show the concept of automated tracking, prediction, and risk assessment.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>What are some limitations of ASTRA?</summary>
        <p>ASTRA uses simplified models, limited data, and runs on a small scale compared to real systems. It is meant for learning and demonstration, not for live satellite control.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>How does ASTRA help make space more sustainable?</summary>
        <p>By highlighting risky encounters earlier, ASTRA supports decisions that can avoid collisions and reduce the growth of debris in key orbital regions.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Could ASTRA be expanded in the future?</summary>
        <p>Yes. Future versions could use more detailed data, better physics models, and closer integration with real mission planning tools.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Do I need any special software to use ASTRA?</summary>
        <p>For this project, ASTRA is presented as a website with a visualization, so it can be viewed in a modern web browser.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>How can I learn more about ASTRA?</summary>
        <p>You can explore the About page, try the visualization, and read the other pages in this site to see how the system works and what problem it targets.</p>
